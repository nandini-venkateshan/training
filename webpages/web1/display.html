			<p> choreography is a form of self-expression and introspection. Her works range from pieces of the traditional
				repertoire, to unique choreographies that break away from traditional structures. Her creative process unravels,
				investigates, re-energizes, and re-invests accepted ideas, while maintaining classical integrity. The resulting
				exploration centers around image, metaphor, and symbolism, shifting the content of her work from cultural to
				Universal. Her belief in the inherent spirituality of the art form anchors all of her work in some form to the
				idea of “Oneness” and the seeking of it.</p>

						Mythili Prakash belongs to a new generation of classical Indian dancers. She is one of the most celebrated and
						respected young Bharata Natyam dancers today. Her choreographies Jwala – Rising Flame, Stree Katha, Chandalika,
						and MARA are imaginative and highly accessible productions. A second generation Indian and American artist
						Mythili has positioned herself as a global and cosmopolitan artist through her unique experiences and
						collaborations with Anoushka Shankar, Gowri Ramnarayan, Lynn Dally and her musician brother Aditya Prakash. Her
						repertoire is an embodiment of narratives of the many worlds that shape her.</p>

					<p>	“Mythili is an artist who truly carries us to the sublime. She embodies a spectacular combination of narrative
						dimension that is filled with deep insight and invention and a technical form that is dazzlingly impressive. She
						elevates the audience to a sense of wonder.” Judy Mitoma, Producer and Curator – World Festival of Sacred Music
						& Aratani World Series. “This is the magic of the universal appeal of Mythili’s work. Her personal understanding
						of the form allows her to transcend technique. Her physical beauty and athletic performance on the other hand
						make the audience aware that they are in the presence of virtuosic skill at the highest level. This combined
						with her storytelling skills bring the viewer to an emotional appreciation of the divine. It is her surrender to
						the art, her dedication, and her virtuosity that the audience can read and appreciate. The wonder is that she
						was born on American soil.”</p>

					<p>	Raised in Los Angeles, she grew up in an environment filled with dance and music, under the watchful eye of her
						mother and teacher dance exponent Viji Prakash. Mythili began her performing career with her solo debut in India
						at the age of eight and has since performed extensively in prestigious venues and festivals throughout the
						world. She has studied with several legendary stalwarts from India, and is now under the tutelage of India’s
						acclaimed artist, Malavika Sarukkai.</p>

					<p>	Mythili has toured her own solo productions in the United Kingdom, Scotland, France, and Singapore, the United
						States and Mexico. She was featured on NBC’s Superstars of Dance as a Bharata Natyam soloist, introducing her
						art form to all over the world. Mythili also had the honor of working with Director Ang Lee in the award winning
						film Life of Pi and was cast as the wife of Pi.</p>

					<p>	Mythili is recipient of numerous accolades from premiere institutions of Dance and Music in India. She is a
						recipient of the Creation to Performance Grant from the Irvine Dance Foundation and Artistic Innovation Grant
						from the Center for Cultural Innovation.
